# The-Journey-To-Data-Science
Maybe it was a dream to study Data Science but it happened, A month ago I started internship at IBM in Machine Learning and Data Science.

We started learn "IBM SPSS Modeler" from "Introduction to IBM SPSS Modeler And Data Mining (v16)" then "Advanced Data Preparation Using IMB SPSS Modeler (v16)"
I took 3 weeks to finish it, then my instructor decide to solve in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"> Kaggle </a> Instantly I was happy
but when he showed the problem that we will try to solve it and apply the principles we have learned, I terrified because it not problem 
to train it is business have $1,200,000 Prize Money <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1"> Zillow’s Home</a>

I finished my day then return to my home and I dreamed of a million.

## Zillow’s Home
I begin read data dictionary of the problem features and do data visualization to know what is the best or complete features I can use
I found that 
<ul>

  <li>bedroomcnt</li>
  <li>Milk</li>

  <li>taxamount</li>
</ul>
is very important to achieve the target of predict log error, I solved random without anything of thinking only put nodes next to 
other until I reach to complete the missing data with (mean - median - my eye vision) I cant understand
